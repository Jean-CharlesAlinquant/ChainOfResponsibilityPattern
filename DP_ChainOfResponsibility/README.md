# Chain of Responsibility Pattern Definition

The Proxy pattern allows an object to pass a request along a chain of handlers until the request is handled or reaches the end of the chain.
This pattern decouples the sender of a request from its receiver, enabling multiple objects to handle the request without the sender needing to know which object ultimately handles it.
